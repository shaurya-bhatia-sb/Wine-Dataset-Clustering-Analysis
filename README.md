# Wine-Dataset-Clustering-Analysis

This repository explores clustering techniques applied to the Wine dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The aim is to group similar wines based on chemical properties by experimenting with different preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and clustering algorithms, and to evaluate their performance across various metrics.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:

Apply clustering algorithms on the Wine dataset.
Experiment with scaling techniques and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
Evaluate clustering performance using Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Score, and Davies-Bouldin Score.
This analysis provides insights into unsupervised learning techniques and can serve as a template for clustering analysis on similar datasets.

# Dataset
The Wine dataset, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, consists of 13 chemical properties of wine samples from three different cultivars. The target variable Class is omitted for clustering analysis, treating it as an unsupervised learning task.


# Features:
Attributes: Alcohol, Malic_acid, Ash, Alcalinity, Magnesium, Phenols, Flavanoids, Nonflavanoid, Proanthocyanins, Color_intensity, Hue, OD280/OD315, Proline.
Target: Class (omitted for clustering).
